Strap in, folks! We've turned a Latin American card game into a crypto rodeo, and it's more lit than a chili pepper at a fireworks factory. Here's the lowdown:

- Pay your dues in COQ tokens to enter the stampede.

- Four brave souls saddle up, and then it's "Hi-ho, Silver!" time.

- Cards are shuffled by the mystical Chainlink VRF, because we like our randomness like we like our memes‚Äîdank and unquestionable.

- Winner takes all? Almost. We've got a tax plan with more layers than an onion wearing a vest:

  - A scorching 12% tax evaporates into the blockchain ether.

  - A crafty 3% tax slides into the dev's war chest for more shenanigans.

  - The spoils of victory? Poured into the winner's goblet, minus the meme tax.

Taxonomics:

- The burn tax is like a dragon on a cheat day‚Äîfiery and insatiable.

- The dev tax is like feeding a Tamagotchi, so it grows strong and gives us more features.

We're in the final furlong with the frontend show and the contract's test of strength. The Hackathon clock played a game of "catch me if you can," but we're no slowpokes. Just a smidgen more patience, and this derby will be dashing towards a more interactive horizon. Keep your eyes peeled like bananas at a monkey buffet!
